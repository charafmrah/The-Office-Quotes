# The Office Quotes

A simple Android app that displays quotes from The Office. I created this app to learn how to use RecylcerView, Adapters, LinearLayout, and CardViews.

The app could be improved by adding a database or connecting to an API to access the quotes, but that's outside the scope of this simple project.
